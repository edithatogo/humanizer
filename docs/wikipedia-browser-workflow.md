This document outlines the steps for executing the Wikipedia edit using a headful browser with user login assistance.

## Prerequisites

- Valid Wikipedia account with editing privileges
- Stable internet connection
- Updated web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Access to the edit draft document: `docs/wikipedia-edit-draft.md`

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Preparation Phase

1. **Review the edit draft**: Carefully read through `docs/wikipedia-edit-draft.md` to understand the proposed changes
2. **Verify citations**: Ensure all citations in the draft are accessible and accurate
3. **Check Wikipedia policies**: Review Wikipedia's policies on editing, particularly:
   - Neutral Point of View (WP:NPOV)
   - Reliable Sources (WP:RS)
   - Original Research (WP:OR)

### 2. Browser Setup

1. **Open your preferred browser**: Launch Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge
2. **Navigate to Wikipedia**: Go to https://en.wikipedia.org
3. **Login to your account**: Click "Log in" in the top-right corner and enter your credentials
4. **Verify login**: Confirm that your username appears in the top-right corner

### 3. Navigate to Target Page

1. **Go to the target page**: Navigate to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing
2. **Check page protection status**: Verify the page is not protected from editing
3. **Review current content**: Read the current page content to ensure your edit is appropriate

### 4. Edit Execution

1. **Click "Edit"**: Click the "Edit" button at the top of the article
2. **Select editing mode**: Choose either "VisualEditor" or "Source Editor" (source editor recommended for structural changes)
3. **Make the changes**: 
   - Add the new "Reasoning Failure Patterns" section
   - Include the 8 subcategories with definitions and examples
   - Add the new citations to the references section
4. **Preview changes**: Use the "Show preview" button to review your changes
5. **Revise as needed**: Make adjustments based on the preview

### 5. Quality Assurance

1. **Verify neutrality**: Ensure the edit maintains Wikipedia's neutral point of view
2. **Check formatting**: Confirm the edit follows Wikipedia's formatting guidelines
3. **Validate citations**: Ensure all citations are properly formatted and accessible
4. **Spell-check**: Review for any spelling or grammatical errors

### 6. Submit Edit

1. **Add edit summary**: Enter a brief, descriptive edit summary (e.g., "Added section on LLM reasoning failure patterns based on recent research")
2. **Minor edit checkbox**: Uncheck this unless your edit is truly minor
3. **Save changes**: Click the "Publish changes" button
4. **Confirm submission**: If prompted, confirm the submission

### 7. Post-Submission Verification

1. **Verify changes**: Check that your changes appear correctly on the page
2. **Monitor for reversion**: Watch the page for the next 48 hours to see if your edit is reverted
3. **Check discussion page**: Monitor the article's talk page for any feedback about your edit

## Potential Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Edit Conflict
- **Solution**: If someone else edited the page simultaneously, you'll see an edit conflict. Review the other user's changes and adjust yours accordingly.

### Issue: Edit Reverted
- **Documentation**: If your edit is reverted, document this in `docs/wikipedia-edit-history.md` with:
  - Date and time of reversion
  - Reason given for reversion (if any)
  - Username of reverting user
  - Your response plan

### Issue: Account Restrictions
- **Solution**: If your account has restrictions, you may need to request editing privileges or coordinate with an established editor.

## Monitoring Schedule

- **24-hour check**: Check the edit status after 24 hours
- **48-hour check**: Final check after 48 hours to confirm permanence
- **Weekly check**: Monitor for a week to catch any delayed reversion

## Fallback Plan

If the edit is reverted:
1. Document the reversion in `docs/wikipedia-edit-history.md`
2. Review the feedback on the talk page
3. Revise the edit based on community feedback
4. Consider discussing the edit on the article's talk page before re-attempting
