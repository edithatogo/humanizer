# Wikipedia Edit Application and Submission

This document details the process for applying and submitting the Wikipedia edit based on our research.

## Edit Application Process

### 1. Content Integration

The new content should be integrated into the existing "Signs of AI writing" page structure:

#### Location
- Add the new "Reasoning Failure Patterns" section after the current "Style Patterns" section
- Before the "Communication Patterns" section

#### Format
- Use the existing heading hierarchy (== for main sections, === for subsections)
- Follow the existing formatting conventions
- Maintain the same level of detail and example quality as existing sections

### 2. Citation Integration

#### New References
Add the following citations to the References section:

1. Rujeedawa, A., et al. (2025). "On the Effect of Reasoning Depth on Large Language Model Performance." *arXiv preprint arXiv:2602.06176*.
2. Desaire, J., et al. (2023). "Detecting AI-Generated Text: A Machine Learning Approach." *arXiv preprint*.
3. Terçon, P., et al. (2025). "Identifying and Mitigating Reasoning Failures in LLMs." *arXiv preprint*.
4. Zhong, K., et al. (2024). "Semantic Fingerprinting for LLM Output Detection." *arXiv preprint*.

#### In-Text Citations
