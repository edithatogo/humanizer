# Humanizer Reasoning Module: LLM Reasoning Failures

This module identifies and addresses reasoning failures in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs that manifest as detectable patterns in the generated text.

## DESCRIPTION

LLMs can exhibit various types of reasoning failures that affect the quality and reliability of their outputs. These failures often manifest in the generated text through specific patterns that can be identified and addressed.

## REASONING FAILURE CATEGORIES

### 1. Depth-Dependent Reasoning Failures
- **Sign:** Accuracy decreases as reasoning chain lengthens
- **Action:** Simplify complex explanations, remove tangential content, ensure focus

### 2. Context-Switching Failures
- **Sign:** Difficulty maintaining coherence across different knowledge domains
- **Action:** Smooth transitions between topics, maintain consistent register and tone

### 3. Temporal Reasoning Limitations
- **Sign:** Errors in temporal sequence or causal reasoning tasks
- **Action:** Clarify chronological order, strengthen causal connections

### 4. Abstraction-Level Mismatches
- **Sign:** Difficulty maintaining appropriate level of abstraction
- **Action:** Bridge abstraction gaps with clear connections

### 5. Logical Fallacy Susceptibility
- **Sign:** Systematic reasoning errors that contradict formal logic
- **Action:** Identify and correct logical inconsistencies

### 6. Quantitative Reasoning Deficits
- **Sign:** Errors in numerical computation or quantitative understanding
- **Action:** Flag questionable numerical claims for review

### 7. Self-Consistency Failures
- **Sign:** Internal contradictions within a single output
- **Action:** Identify and resolve internal contradictions

### 8. Verification and Checking Deficiencies
- **Sign:** Lack of internal verification mechanisms
- **Action:** Add appropriate qualifiers, acknowledge uncertainties

## APPLICATION RULES

### When to Apply
- When text quality critically depends on logical consistency
- When dealing with technical, academic, or factual content
- When surface-level fixes are insufficient for naturalness

### When Not to Apply
- For general casual writing where logical depth isn't critical
- When computational efficiency is paramount
- When the text is already logically sound

## INTEGRATION WITH OTHER MODULES

- Core Humanizer addresses surface-level writing quality issues
- Reasoning module addresses deeper logical consistency issues
- Both modules can operate independently or in combination
- Reasoning module defers to Core for surface-level fixes

## QUALITY STANDARDS

All reasoning diagnostics must meet these standards:
- Corrections must be logically sound
- Claims must be verifiable or appropriately qualified
- Changes must improve accuracy and consistency
- Evidence for diagnoses must be documented
