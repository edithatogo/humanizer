# Reasoning Stream Module

This module focuses on identifying and addressing reasoning failures in AI-generated text.

## Purpose

The reasoning stream module supplements the core humanization patterns by specifically targeting failures in the logical reasoning processes of LLMs that manifest in the generated text.

## Categories of Reasoning Failures

### 1. Depth-Dependent Reasoning Failures
- **Detection**: Look for overly complex explanations that lose focus or coherence
- **Remediation**: Simplify complex explanations, remove tangential content, ensure focus

### 2. Context-Switching Failures
- **Detection**: Identify abrupt topic changes without proper transitions or inconsistent register/tone
- **Remediation**: Smooth transitions between topics, maintain consistent register and tone

### 3. Temporal Reasoning Limitations
- **Detection**: Find confused chronology or unclear cause-and-effect relationships
- **Remediation**: Clarify temporal sequences, strengthen causal connections

### 4. Abstraction-Level Mismatches
- **Detection**: Spot sudden jumps between concrete examples and abstract concepts without connection
- **Remediation**: Bridge abstraction gaps with clear connections

### 5. Logical Fallacy Susceptibility
- **Detection**: Identify circular reasoning, false dichotomies, hasty generalizations
- **Remediation**: Identify and correct logical inconsistencies

### 6. Quantitative Reasoning Deficits
- **Detection**: Flag inaccurate statistics or misleading numerical comparisons
- **Remediation**: Flag questionable numerical claims for review

### 7. Self-Consistency Failures
- **Detection**: Find contradictory statements or changing positions mid-document
- **Remediation**: Identify and resolve internal contradictions

### 8. Verification and Checking Deficiencies
- **Detection**: Notice presentation of uncertain information as definitive or failure to acknowledge limitations
- **Remediation**: Add appropriate qualifiers, acknowledge uncertainties

## Integration with Core Humanizer

The reasoning stream module works alongside the core humanization patterns:

1. Core Humanizer addresses surface-level writing quality issues
2. Reasoning stream addresses deeper logical consistency issues
3. Both modules can operate independently or in combination
4. Reasoning stream defers to core Humanizer for surface-level fixes

## Application Guidelines

### When to Use
- When text quality critically depends on logical consistency
- When dealing with technical, academic, or factual content
- When surface-level fixes are insufficient for naturalness

### When Not to Use
- For general casual writing where logical depth isn't critical
- When computational efficiency is paramount (reasoning checks add overhead)
- When the text is already logically sound

## Quality Standards

All reasoning diagnostics must meet these standards:
- Corrections must be logically sound
- Claims must be verifiable or appropriately qualified
- Changes must improve accuracy and consistency
- Evidence for diagnoses must be documented
